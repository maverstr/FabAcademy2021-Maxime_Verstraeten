# 3. Computer-Controlled Cutting

## Objectives

<div class="objectivePanel">
  <ul>
    <li> Group assignment: characterize your lasercutter's focus, power, speed, rate, kerf, joint clearance and types. </li>
    <li> Cut something on the vinylcutter.</li>
    <li>  Design, lasercut and document a parametric construction kit, accounting for the lasercutter kerf whiuch can be assembled in multiple ways.</li>
    <li> Try to include elements which aren't flat.</li>

This week is about computer-controlled cutting, meaning that we get to cut and slice things using digitally-controlled tools such as a laser or vinyl cutter.

This is very much linked with previous week's class as now, I'll have no other choice than to use CAD tools to make my design and then export them to the cutting tools.

I'll have 3 objectives this week.

- I would like to make a very small electronics circuit using copper tape and the vinyl cutter. I don't expect very nice results with it but if it works sufficiently well, then it might an extremely quick way to make some traces without the need to order a PCB or make using a CNC or chemical processes. Moreover, that makes for easy flexible circuits if I ever need some.

- Before this, I want to get some experiments using the vinyl cutter by simply slicing some stickers with some logos !

- Finally, I have relatively big desk at work but just like every desk, it gets clumped with all sorts of stuff. My biggest issue is that my laptop rests on a cardboard box (so that it sits at eye-level) and sometimes when I need to takes notes during online meetings, I don't have enough room in front of my laptop because of this huge cardboard box. So I want to make a press-fit kit like a small table where I can leave my laptop on and slide my keyboard underneath.


## 1. Tools
Multiple tools exist to cut things. Some are more expensive, some are easier to use, some a safer but mainly it depends on what you want to do and especially the machines that you have available at your Fablab.

Among these:

### Knifes Tools
By knife tools I mean the tools that use a piece of metal like a knife to cut through paper (in 2D of course). The vinyl cutter is a perfect example of it.
At the Fablab ULB we have the Silhouette Camo 3 that uses a small blade to cut paper, cardboard ou textiles up to 30cm width and 3 meters long !
Cool feature: the blade can be replaced with a pen to make dashed lines and can locate itself on the paper using pattern images.

There are multiple other types of knife tools that can punch, roll, shear paper... But those are super expensive and we don't have these kinds at the ULB.

Some cutters use ultrasonic energy to melt plastic or burn wood at the same time of cutting ! I would love to try one of these a day.


### Laser cutters
We have a [CO2 60W EPILOG MINI](https://www.epiloglaser.com/assets/downloads/manuals/legend-manual-web.pdf) with a working surface of 30x60cm and that is interfaced with CorelDraw.

### And the rest !
Plasma, waterjet, hot wire, wire EDM
