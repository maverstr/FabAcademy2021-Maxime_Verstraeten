This week I tried to establish a sketch of my project. It's quite hard as I don't really know what will be possible and I will probably need to revisit my ideas multiple time during my FabAc journey.


## Intro
Because I'm doing my PhD full-time concurrently with the FabAcademy, I'll try to stay in the scope of my PhD subject.

Currently, I have a barely working silicone bladder phantom that I would like to improve and test several sensors that could be implanted inside.

To do so, I will first need to improve the phantom design and the manufacturing process. I will also need to find new ways to replicate the physiological behavior of the bladder and anchor my novel sensors on my bladder.

I will also need to design the electronics to measure my sensors' outputs and communicate them all to a central node that will be able to process the data to monitor the bladder activity.

I have only a few ideas at the moment but it is extremely likely that things will evolve over time.
