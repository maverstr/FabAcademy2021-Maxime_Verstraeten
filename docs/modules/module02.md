# 2. Computer-Aided Design

## Objectives
<div class="objectivePanel">
  <ul>
    <li> Model (raster, vector, 2D, 3D, render, animate, simulate, ...) a possible final project, compress your images and videos, and post it on your class page </li>
    <li> Test as much softwares for 2D and 3D designs</li>
  </ul>
</div>


So this week I wanted to experience multiple design tools. I am not really a creative guy at first but on the other hand, I always wanted to learn how to use such softwares to be able to make some logos, some art and, as I am a teaching assistant, I want to be able to use such tools to make my courses more comprehensible.


I already had some basic knowledge of SolidWorks but it is the opportunity to learn more about other tools and how they work. In particular, I am really eager to test Antimony as I find the workflow so much different that everything else !

### 2D-design: What did I do?

So I first wanted to experience 2D design.

I installed [Adobe Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/be_fr/products/illustrator.html), [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/), [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/), [Concepts](https://concepts.app/en/) and [Sketchbook](https://sketchbook.com/).

The main differences being that Illustrator is proprietary and costly, Sketchbook is also proprietary (Autodesk) but free while Inkscape and GIMP are both free and open-source.

#### Inkscape
Inkscape is used to make vector graphics (usually SVG files) meaning it is best used when drawing shapes, curves and text that can be later limitlessly scaled whiled still producing clean lines. This is especially important when the logo need to be printed or made available in a variety of sizes. Also, the colors of each object can be easily changed which makes it very easy to change the color of a logo or any other design.

_I will try to make a logo for my project using Inkscape._

!!!info "Alternatives"
    Adobe Illustrator is basically the proprietary equivalent of Inkscape.

#### GIMP
GIMP on the other hand uses raster graphics, meaning that everything is displayed as pixels in a grid. When zooming on a file opened in GIMP it becomes very clear that every color in the image actually corresponds to a pixel. GIMP elements are therefore not scalable !

Therefore Gimp is more useful when manipulating or editing natural photos as each pixel can be manipulated. It is also easy to adjust colors, brightness, contrast, temperature, saturation, ...

Also, as it is not a vector-graphics tool, it is better for free-hand drawing than Inkscape for example as vector-graphics tools will always need to slightly adjust the curve to make it fit a mathematical equation. For pixel-perfect drawing, GIMP is therefore better.

!!!info "Alternatives"
    Adobe Photoshop is the proprietary equivalent of Gimp.

#### Sketchbook
Sketchbook is a bitmap program. That means that just like GIMP and contrary to Illustrator or Inkscape, it won't create vector-graphics or SVG files. On the other hand that makes it perfect for hand-drawings. It features many brushes, transform features and so on. Additional sets and features are available for free by the community.

!!!tip
    I found the very nice [Hudson Rio's bush set](https://blogs.autodesk.com/sketchbookpro/free-brush-set-hudson-rios-industrial-design-brushes/) for Sketchbook. In my own opinion, the pencil looks the better and the airbrush is godsent. I really recommend it (and it's free so try it out !). Simply download it and drag&drop it inside Sketchbook for it to appear in the available brush sets. You can pin it to the palette for easy access. So easy!

!!!info "Alternatives"
    [Concepts](https://concepts.app/en/) for lightweight/rapid prototyping. It features "hybrid vector-raster engine" that makes the strokes sharp at any zoom level before exportation. The "infinite canevas" is also an extremely nice option when brainstorming for ideas and testing out things.

    [Vectornator](https://www.vectornator.io/) is another vector-graphics tool that looks very promising but I didn't get the chance to explore it as its only available to iOS and macOS devices.

    [Krita](https://krita.org/fr/): open-source and free.

Note that both Concepts and sketchbook are free but exist in "Pro" versions with added features that come with a price (but still way less expensive than Adobe's products).


#### Powerpoint
I also used Powerpoint to make animations and some nice designs but I feel like it was less difficult :smile:. Powerpoint was always my go-to software to make a quick animation or design when I wanted to explain something in a paper or a video but it really lacks drawing capabilities and I feel like I'll be using Sketchbook and GIMP way more in the future for this.

## 3D-design: What did I do?

## To go further
I just ordered a XP-Pen Star03 V2 drawing tablet off Amazon to further enhance my skills in 2D-design and to enjoy it more ! It will also certainly be useful for any lecture I might teach online during the academic year.
