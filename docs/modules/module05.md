# Week 5



To scan my head and this bottle of beer, I downloaded [Autodesk Recap Pro](https://www.autodesk.com/products/recap/overview?plc=RECAP&term=1-YEAR&support=ADVANCED&quantity=1).
 The software is extremely powerful and is capable of generating 3D model based on at least 30 images. These images can be simply taken with a smartphone camera without even needing to be in precise spatial positions or anyting.
 It is unfortunately pricey but a free-trial exists and just like (almost) all Autodesk's products, it's free if you have an .edu mail address.

 Recap will then try to reconstruct the point clouds in 3D and you can then slice or adjust the model before exporting it.
