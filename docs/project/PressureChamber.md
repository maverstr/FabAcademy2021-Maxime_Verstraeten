# Pressure chamber

To model the detrusor pressure, some researchers developped a pressure chamber in which they can control the inside pressure.

It is very basic and I would try to re-do it while adding some features.

## Objective
The objective is to have an hermetic box connected to a pressure sensor and a pump and be able to reach 1.5atm of pressure inside the chamber. A nice addition would be to be able to suddenly open a valve to have a very fast increase of pressure but this has not been done (yet !).

## The mechanical design

The design is very simple, a rectangular box in plexiglass (PMMA) with some inputs and outputs. To make sure these outputs are sealed and airtight, I use a D-sub connector for the electronics with additional flange and screw kit for sealing, and I apply a silicone sealing around each fluidic connector.

The dimensions are: 250x300x350mm

I use wood for the bottom plate in order to have a stable base that is high enough to be able to screw things in it.
The plexiglass is recycled from other various projects so there are multiple colors and multiple width.

I cut it using the laser cutter (and Inkscape basic shapes like rectangles and arcs).

To hold it all together, I designed and 3D-printed some very simple holders and used the Acrifix192 glue which is made for PMMA. It cures with UV light (about 20min outside in the sun). I tried to use a UV light machine to make it cure faster but it doesn't really work out because the UV spot is too small to be useful and because the light diffuses in the plexiglass.
